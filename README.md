## House Prices Advanced Regression Techniques

In this project we will be using a Kaggle Dataset containing 79 variables holding information about residential properties sold in Iowa. We will explore the data and identify key variables, process and clean the data and engineer new features. Once ready, we will attempt to predict the sale prices held within our test set and test the performance of our algorithm using root mean squared error (RMSE) &amp; adjusted R squared.  

As this problem requires a regression model, RMSE is a good performance measure. RMSE indicates how closely (in absolute terms) our predicted values are to the actual sale prices and is easy to interpret as it will be in the same units as the original Sale Price. R squared represents a value, from 0 to 1, showing how much of an improvement the model is over simply taking the mean, showing us the 'goodness of fit'. We will use a variant of this, 'adjusted R squared' which will adjust for having multiple variables, especially if they contribute nothing to the model. It should show us the proportion of total variance explained by the model.
